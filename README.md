# Alfred Icon Generator
Icon Generator quickly converts a symbol from SF Symbols to a png for use in workflows.

# Why I made this
I make extensive use of Alfred's List Filters to pop up various little context menus all over the place throughout my being on the computer. I like to include icons for many of these entries, for example, here is my Audio Hijack loudness adapted volume control popup menu:

So I needed a way to quickly generate pretty and consistent icons…
 
And this is it. Basically you just need to get a symbol on your clipboard and run the workflow. Now your clipboard will be updated with an icon version (png) of the symbol – ready to be pasted into your workflow.

## Step one
copy icon from SF Symbols

## Step two
Run workflow

## Step three
Paste your new icon wherever you like

That's it.

You'll need to have SF Pro font installed on your system. And you'll also need ImageMagick
